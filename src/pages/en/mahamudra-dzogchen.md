Guru Natan is the sole holder in the West of a very special Mahamudra method from Vajravarahi to Lawapa which became the basis of Lord Gampopa's Five-Fold Path Mahamudra in the Drikung Kagyu. The name of the method is secret as well as the contents. It does not require an empowerment. It is given to those who show great devotion.

The second very special method Guru Natan can teach is the method of yangti and a dream yoga practice that is in the yangti mode of practice. You can think of it as tregcho and thogal on steriods.

The third are the direct introductions that later became know as mTha'-chen... These are said to bring near immediate understanding of the entire path of the Buddha's wisdom.

Finally, all the pith instructions of the Drikung Kagyu on Ganga Mahamudra, Co-Emergent Mahamudra, Guhyagarbha Tantra and a plethora of deity yog methods from Kagyu and Nyingma. Also  Dungtso Repa's Black Yangti and pith instructions on tregcho and thogal.
