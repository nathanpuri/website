We begin with instructions on bodhicitta, the awakening oneself to the enlightened intent of the Buddhas with contemplation on Avalokiteshvara, the prajñāpāramitā of the single syllable A and the mantra "aum manipadme hūm [shrī]" to generate great love, compassion and awakening. 

Every Saturday at 9:00 hours in the morning at the park in the Museu da República in Rio de Janeiro next to the duck pond.
