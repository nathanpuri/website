Natan was encouraged to teach by Kyabj√© Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche and Drubpon Gonpo Dorje Rinpoche of the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages on the subjects of Atiyoga (Dzogchen) and Mahamudra. He lives in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Due to the difficulty in finding a word that reflects both lineages of instruction, Natan invented the word Atisiddhi, which is a Sanskrit way of saying it. There could be others. It helps to use less words.

Natan most enjoys introducing the nature of mind and the transcendant experience of Samantabhadra that comes with it. There is no need to engage in methods and practices. He teaches from the level of Yangti, beyond it, mTha'-chen, and even beyond that, Atisiddhi.
