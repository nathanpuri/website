Haiku directly confronting dharmadhatu for peace and joy.

After many years of learning and practice in the most secret oral instructions of Tibetan Buddhism which are forbidden to be written and may only be taught to those who show great devotion (in both Nyingma and Kagyu lineages), Natan was encouraged to teach by Kyabjé Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche and Drubpon Gonpo Dorje Rinpoche. 

Natan did as his lamas commanded which was first to master a great tantra and certain important mantra practices. Ten years after being instructed to teach and after receiving the various empowerments he wandered alone around the world, practicing each of the pujas according to the instructions and learning how best to work them in modern life, while diligently applying the oral instructions daily.

Due to the strict secrecy of his transmissions, the scarcity of people who wish to be trained according to Tibetan-style training, instead of watering down the instructions, Natan has devised a new way to go about transmitting the authentic experiential knowledge of buddhahood and making that part of one´s daily life. It is appropriate and preferred for working people with worldly concerns, those who can accept a great life challenge. 

Natan is not teaching in the traditional manner of Tibetan Buddhism, tied to lineages and specific cycles of transmissions, because there are numerous highly qualified teachers who are doing that all over the world. Rather, he focuses on what is unique to his experience with his teachers. That is, he focuses on the direct transmission of the entire breadth of Vajrayana in the fewest possible words, and actually the methodology is very traditional, just very rare.

This is for those who wish to skip ahead and test out of the common curriculum. Though the receiving is brief, the path is not. One must commit to it to incorporate the experiences into one's primary mode of consciousness.

Therefore, we will away from the common class of instructors so prevalent on the internet and in dharma centers limited by tradition and classical Tibetan literature. Natan is doing exactly what his lama's bade him to do: to find a new way to teach the highest teachings in Vajrayana in the clearest way with the fewest words. 

Natan will use haiku and other terse means directly to confront the dharmadhatu for peace and joy.
