This is not a path of meditation, nor are there any lists of practices to learn. We chose the term "Atisiddhi" because it is a Sanskrit word that means Atiyoga, Dzogchen, Great Perfection, Chagya Chenpo, Mahamudra, Prajnaparamita, etc. It is simply a simply way to refer to a notion that all the lineages of Vajrayana understand without having constantly to say, "In Dzogchen teachings... x, y and/or z"; or "In Mahamudra and/or Dzogchen and/or Great Madhyamaka..." or "Union of Samsara and Nirvana," "separating samsara and nirvana," "nonduality," "dharmakaya," "dharmadhatu," etc. This is a more effecient mode of expression to convey what all the lineages mean to say.

Further, when one refers to "Dzogchen," one refers to an inherent quality of mind. Whereas, when one refers to "Dzogchen Teachings," one refers to a very diverse list of textual and organizatinal histories of instruction and practice. The same is true of "Mahamudra," "tantra," "mantra," "Vajrayana," "Sutrayana," etc. It becomes very difficult to make generalizations about what is essentially one whole, or to use something from one lineage and make it make sense in another. What one comes to with the latter approach of discrete distinctness in teachings Tibetan Buddhism is at least four different religions, but probably even many more than this.

One of the ways Natan has been able to identify who has received the higher experiential knowledge if not the higher experiential instructions is those who have understood the interconnectedness and unity among lineages. The sad reality is there are so few such yogis who want to teach at all and for good reason, folks tend either to take a self-teaching approach or adhere too much to texts and/or traditions.

The happy reality is the methods for transmitting the wisdom of a Buddha very quickly do exist, can be taught, can be practiced in ordinary life, and reap amazing benefits for one's life. Therefore "Atisiddhi" are those teachings at the upper limit of what is possible to transmit with regard to experiential buddhadharma. You are invited to request them, learn them and put them to good use in your home. 

Natan will first deliver haiku directly to confront the dharmadhatu, or as direct introduction to the nature of mind, direct introduction to rigpa, and so on, as the terms are used.
