The Buddha taught three baskets of teachings: Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidharma. I won't get into details here, but Google can help you here find further details. In the sutra section, he taught three wheels, or three turnings, as it is sometimes called: the Shravakayana, the Prajnaparamita and the Tathagatagarbha. Each of these turnings corresponds to a different set of baskets. The baskets are Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidharma. Each turning is meant to clarify what is merely implied in the earlier turning. The Vajrayana is part of the Abhidharma basket of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra turning and it's Vinaya basket varies based on Samaya provided in the tantra.

The Tathagatagarbha Sutras introduce the Buddhanature, and innate potential for Buddhahood and what the full blossoming of that potential entails. The Vajrayana then gives extensive details about the Buddhanature and how it is activated and allowed to develop. This can be accomplished in one life, rather than many lives, as in Mahayana, because direct methods involving the human body are used, rather than indirect methods involving relationships with other beings.

The Vajrayana also has many lineages and each lineage teaches that Vajrayana has many levels involving varying degrees of perfection of "The View." Depending on the lineage the Apex View will either be called Mahamudra (The Majority View) or Dzogchen (The Minority View). However, a modern approach is called Rim√© or ecumenical, and with some ancient precidents like Lord Jigten Sumgon, there is the view that all the views are the same and discrimination between views is ignorant. This approach, which can be called the nondiscriminatory approach included the sutra basket of Prajnaparamita and it's Abhidharma related with Madhyamaka. In one text called Gongchig it also includes the Shravakayana and Shravaka Vinaya, as well as equating the Four Immeasurables, a Shravakayana sutra teaching, with Buddhahood.

A unique feature of Lord Jigten Sumgon's approach is the the first wheel Buddha taught interdependence of cause and effect. In the second wheel he taught cause and effect are empty. And in the third wheel he taught Buddhanature or emptiness in action is interdependent cause and effect. So all the wheels and baskets are interdependent, like a fractal, and so practicing in one wheel entails practicing all.

What a Buddha is in essence is one who automatically responds with compassionate wisdom to assist beings to see what a Buddha sees. What this entails about the third turning is a path to Buddhahood by doing Buddha activities. And by engaging in Buddha activities we learn to master this skill and then that skill grows in power and scope. Thus, we are freed from the burden of time, stages and levels of achievement and can allow our Buddhanature to blossom at our own pace. Due to the truth of interdependent cause and effect, by engaging in Buddha activities we naturally develop the countless samadhis and enjoyments that are shared nondually with all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

What we will do is utilize the tools the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha have provided over 2,600 years of history, from the most basic first turning methods, to the utter limit of what it possible to be taught in Vajrayana and the gurus' intimate experiential instructions and learn how to engage in Buddha activities for our own and others' benefits.

With the counsel of a teacher one can develop a very high level of experience with the Buddha's teachings without having to commit to an extensive practice schedule, without having to renounce the world in years long retreats, and without having to attend numerous lamas and empowerments. The historical precedents for my approach to teaching are well founded in the records in India, Nepal and Tibet. What I've come to is based on applying the traditional approaches to modern life and discovering which tools have the best impact in the lives of people whom I encounter.

Practices to gain familiarity with Buddha activities include recitation of sutras, making various offerings, recitations of prayers, tantric visualizations, occasional rituals, introductions to direct perception of Buddhanature and ways to maintain that perception night and day thought all activities.
