My name is Nathan Puri. I was born in South Eastern Oregon in the high desert, but spent most of my youth and education in Northern California. I started going by Natan when I moved to Brazil because that's how they spell and pronounce it and so it's easier.

I've been studying and practicing Mahayana and Vajrayana since 2008. My principle teachers include lamas from Kagyu and Nyingma, although I've received empowerments from all lineages of Tibetan Buddhism and Taiwanese Mahayana and consider myself ecumenical. I have many refuge names: Konchok Ã–sel Rigpa'i Dorje, Kunzang Dondrubpa, and others. I'm not Tibetan and don't try to be. My granduncle raised me to be Indian. That's what I understand.

In my childhood I was greatly influenced by my granduncle who was a lifelong yogi who studied in Benares. In university I was greatly influenced by the study of metaphysics, aesthetics, poetics and semiotics. These early experiences strongly informed my study and experience of the Vajrayana.

I earned a certificate in Mahamudra training from HH Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche in 2014. I had been teaching Mahamudra at Tze Zhan Monastery in San Francisco for five years. During this period I had learned from a well known Dzogchen scholar in France about a path of Dzogchen teachings higher than Nyingthig and Yangti known as mTha-Chen, meaning utter limit. It's related with the system of Dzogchen which is no longer in practice, known as pyiti, chiti and Yangti. I simply found this ancient way of approaching Dzogchen practice to make more sense and the way I personally experienced it. I had a well-known Dzogchen scholar in the USA translate the 21 Introductions of the Dzogchen tantras, which are a basic framework for the mTha-Chen.

Also in 2014, during a retreat with Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche he gave me an oral examination about the nature of Dzogchen and confirmed my experiences of the fourth vision and the body of light. At that time, he gave me authority to teach. Thus I am authorized to practice and teach Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

In 2016, I received a complete transmission of the Guhyagarbha Tantra and the Chetsun Nyingthig by Khenchen Namdrol. I was very inspired by it and began a journey around the world to perfect it's practice. I wandered throughout Asia and North America for three years and then in 2019 began wandering around Brazil until the present.

Since 2019, I've been working though personal and professional teaching issues with Brendan Byrne and his insistence on rigor. He has been my sole student during this period. Together we are working out what is the best course of action form the future of my teaching career.

What we are hovering over to land upon is a practical approach to dharma that will provide the most usefulness in daily life, that is, to manage negative emotions, anxiety, neuroses, stresses, mood swings and such and to encourage positive qualities like courage, patience, gentleness and kindness. And we are focusing on lay persons who would not normally have a lot of time to meditate, do rituals and go on retreats.

Please read more on the teachings to learn more about the teaching approach.

PS According to the Rig Veda, the Puri clan are direct descendants of the god Brahma. I'm not one to put meaning on such claims, but I see that touted by followers of Tibetan lamas, that they descend from holy beings. But they can't do better than a grandson of Brahma, especially when the the major and minor marks of Buddha are the marks of a Brahma. I descend from the gods! And get really pouty when my blood sugar is low. I also descend from Genghis Khan, along with 200,000,000 other Asians. So there's that. Then we will burn the villages and towns of King Mara. Who's with me?!
