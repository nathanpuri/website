My name is Nathan. I was born in South Eastern Oregon in the high desert, but spent most of my youth and education in Northern California near amount Shasta. My father was an immigrant from India from the Puru clan mentioned in the Rig Veda. My mother's family immigrated from the Alsace 170 years ago. I started going by Natan when I moved to Brazil because that's how they spell and pronounce it and so it's easier. 

In my childhood I was greatly influenced by my granduncle who was a lifelong yogi educated in Benares during the British Raj and trained me in yoga and Sanskrit.  At university I was greatly influenced by the study of metaphysics, aesthetics, poetics and semiotics in the Philosophy department. These early experiences strongly informed my study and experience of the Vajrayana.

I've been studying and practicing Mahayana and Vajrayana since 2008. My principle teachers include lamas from Kagyu and Nyingma, although I've received empowerments and teachings from all lineages of Tibetan Buddhism and Taiwanese Mahayana and consider myself ecumenical. I have many refuge names: Konchok Ã–sel Rigpa'i Dorje, Kunzang Dondrubpa, and others. I'm not Tibetan and don't try to be. My granduncle raised me in the style of an Indian guru. That's what I understand. So I use the word guru not lama. 

I earned a certificate in Mahamudra training from HH Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche in 2014. I had been teaching Mahamudra at Tze Zhan Monastery in San Francisco for five years. During this period I had learned from a well known Dzogchen scholar in France about a path of Dzogchen teachings higher than Nyingthig and Yangti known as mTha-Chen, meaning utter limit. It's related with the system of Dzogchen which is no longer in practice, known as Pyiti, Chiti and Yangti. I simply found this ancient way of approaching Dzogchen practice to make more sense and the way I personally experienced it. I had a well-known Dzogchen scholar in the USA translate the 21 Introductions of the Dzogchen tantras, which are a basic framework for the mTha-Chen.

Also in 2014, during a retreat with Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche he gave me an oral examination about the four visions of Dzogchen and confirmed my experiences. At that time, he gave me authority to teach. Thus I am authorized to practice and teach Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

In 2016, I received a complete transmission of the Guhyagarbha Tantra and the Chetsun Nyingthig by Khenchen Namdrol. I was very inspired by it and began a journey around the world to perfect it's practice, because it is the most complete Mahayoga class teaching I have and according to Longchenpa is a general or manifold Dzogchen tantra. I wandered throughout Asia and North America for three years and then in 2019 began wandering around Brazil until the present. I wanted to experience the tantras the way the early India practiced. It was recalling lost memories. I did not begin teaching until 2022, except for one man Brendan Byrne of Dublin, Ireland.

Since 2019, I've been working though personal and professional teaching issues with Sir Byrne and his insistence on rigor. He has been my sole student during this period. Together we are working out what is the best course of action for the future of my teaching career.

What we are hovering over to land upon is a practical approach to dharma that will provide the most usefulness in daily life, that is, to manage negative emotions, anxiety, neuroses, stresses, mood swings and such and to encourage positive qualities like courage, patience, gentleness and kindness. And we are focusing on lay persons who would not normally have a lot of time to meditate, do rituals or go on retreats. But the method is profound and one can take it all the way to the final buddhahood in one life. 

I want to pay special homage to my Lama Drubpon Gonpo Dorje Rinpoche and my dharma friend Ani Taoroung with whom  I trained and received the Drikung Kagyu lineage teachings
 She entered tukdam this year 2022 for eight days and all the signs of her complete realization of Mahamudra appeared with our lama by her side practicing and giving final instructions. It's a great testament the path of guru devotion.
