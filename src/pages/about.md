Natan descends from an ancient clan with deep connections to the earliest dharma, is mentioned by name in the Rig Veda and said to descend from Brahma. He began having visions of gurus and ḍākinīs from early childhood. Until 1947 his family lived in what was known as Udyana, the Swat Valley in Pakistan. Natan was trained in yoga and Sanskrit beginning when he was 6 years old by this grandfather from Benares, India. 

He's been studying and practicing Mahayana and Vajrayana since 2008. His principle teachers include lamas from Kagyu and Nyingma, although he's received empowerments and teachings from all lineages of Tibetan Buddhism and Taiwanese Mahayana and considers myself ecumenical. He has many refuge names: Konchok Ösel Rigpa'i Dorje, Kunzang Dondrubpa, and others. His granduncle raised him in the style of an Indian guru. Thus he uses the word guru not lama. 

Natan earned a certificate in Mahamudra training from HH Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche in 2014 and had been teaching Mahamudra at Tze Zhan Monastery in San Francisco for five years. His lama, Drubpon Gonpo Dorje Rinpoche, who always encouraged his teaching activities, blessed him as the only Westerner to receive the highest secret from Lord Jigten Sumgon's Profound Inner Teachings called Mahamudra of the Single White Lotus and the Single Syllable A, which grants realization of Mahamudra to those with the most devotion in a half a day. Natan's dharma sister Ani Taoroung achieved parinirvana after eight days of Thukdam displaying many signs.

During this period he received extensive Atiyoga teachings from several lamas including Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche and completed several three roots, togal and yangti retreats and thus exhibits a high level of proficiency in Vajrayana.
 
Also in 2014, during a retreat with Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche him gave him an oral examination about the four visions of Dzogchen and confirmed his experiences. At that time, he gave Natan authority to teach up to and including Upadesha. Thus he is authorized to practice and teach Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

In 2016, he received a complete transmission of the Guhyagarbha Tantra and the Chetsun Nyingthig by Khenchen Namdrol. He was very inspired by it and began a journey around the world to perfect it's practice. He wandered throughout Asia and North America for three years and then in 2019 began wandering around Brazil until the present and has completed the requirements of Guhyagarbha.

Natan teaches from the tantras, upadeshas and from his own experiential instructions and experiences. He lives in isolation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in constant retreat. His vision is to build a mutually supportive community of full time practicing Vajrayana teachers connected personally and online.
