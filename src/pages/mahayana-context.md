It is vitally important to understand why this guy Gotama bothered to get involved with dharma in the first place. The context for all dharma teaching is the cycle of death and rebirth, sometimes called cyclic existence or samsara in Sanskrit.

Gotama did not get into dharma because he was bummed out, frustrated with life and wanted a way to feel better. He was not concerned for himself at all. He was a prince living a life of luxury that would put most billionaires to shame.

He was a sheltered young man with a controlling father. One day he couldn't take being in the palace and wanted to get out and see the world. So he had his chariot driver secretly drive him around the kingdom.

On this ride he saw some things which he had never seen before or ever even heard of. First, he saw a sick person with sores on the body. He had to ask his driver what he was seeing and his driver told him, "My Lord, that's sickness." Gotama was in shock and awe and asked, "Does that happen to everyone?" And his driver had to be honest, "Yes Lord, This can happen to anyone, even you."

This scene was repeated two more times when Gotama saw and elderly person and then when he saw someone dying. It was then that Gotama understood whosoever is born must also get sick, grow old and die. And in the context of culture of the place and time, it was just accepted that one is reborn after death, whether as a human, animal, ghost, in heaven or hell, one takes a new life. He understood that there is no place beyond birth, old age, sickness and death. At that moment he made a vow to himself that he would solve this problem of universal rebirth into suffering.

He pursued several teachers and tried many methods before he finally found the Middle Way between extremes and began teaching the Four Noble Truths: That rebirth always entails suffering; that rebirth is caused by desire; that the cause may be removed, and the path to remove it is the Noble Eightfold Path which culminates in nirvana or the end of the cycle. The Buddha then saw all his past lives in great detail and knew he had finished with the causes of birth.

No matter which tradition of Buddhism one chooses, the context, the reason and motivation is to avoid being reborn in samsara. Thus, there is no point to practicing dharma which a firm conviction in rebirth due to karmic conditions. The Four Noble Truths are based on karma. Karma means actions whose consequences follow us into subsequent lives.

The Theravada Buddhism tradition seeks to end their own births by various meditation methods and to attain four successive levels of proficiency called Arahantship.

The Mahayana, which includes Vajrayana, Mahamudra and Dzogchen looks deeply at the Buddha's teaching on karma with an eye to being bodhisattvas or those who's goal is not individual liberation from rebirth, but like Gotama, the liberation of all beings as Buddhas.

To accomplish this task a Bodhisattva must remain in the world without being carried away by common ignorance and emotional swings. A Bodhisattva must see samsara and nirvana as an equality, as two sides of the same coin.

Their job is harder and more immediate. They must achieve a level of understanding and mastery over themselves so that they may be active in the world and also be in a deeply meditative state of awareness which is called Bodhicitta or minding awareness. They must solve the problem soon so they may act to assist others without creating more causes for rebirth. Whereas the Theravada prefer to remain in seclusion to avoid contact with further causes of rebirth.

The Vajrayana in particular is rich with ceremony and ritual practice which are active, involving playing instruments, singing, chanting, hand gestures, dancing, eating, drinking, sex, bonfires, and more. Rituals train a person to maintain an awakened mind during activities.

Mahamudra and Dzogchen are from the pith instructions or like the Cliff's Notes or shortcuts that gurus understood from practicing Vajrayana. Technically they are the same meaning and are the result of Vajrayana practice.

Many gurus and lamas today have sometimes understood that Vajrayana is time consuming and requires full-time work. People with families or jobs won't have time for it, but they might be able, if they are smart, to understand the pith instructions and be able to apply them in ordinary life. So an entire independent tradition of pith instruction practice came into existence which does not rely on rituals, but engages with them optionally and for special purposes, like blessings, healings and such.

So what is the context of meditation and dharma? Is it being happy? Successful? Healthy? No. Those are selfish notions. The context of Mahayana is all beings have been reborn countless times, that there have been countless previous lives in countless previous universes which have come and gone and will continue to be reborn forever, that is, unless we do something about it.

Once we come to a firm conviction in our situation of rebirth, old age, sickness and death and rebirth, then we can finally begin to understand Buddha, understand his message and his methods and also enjoy the fruits of pleasure and happiness which will elude us if we do not first put ourselves into the proper context.
