I. 

The Buddha taught three baskets of teachings: Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidharma. I won't get into details here, but Google can help you here find further details. In the sutra section, he taught three wheels, or three turnings, as it is sometimes called: the Shravakayana, the Prajnaparamita and the Tathagatagarbha. Each of these turnings corresponds to a different set of baskets. The baskets are Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidharma. Each turning is meant to clarify what is merely implied in the earlier turning. The Vajrayana is part of the Abhidharma basket of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra turning and it's Vinaya basket varies based on Samaya provided in the tantra.

The Tathagatagarbha Sutras introduce the Buddhanature, and innate potential for Buddhahood and what the full blossoming of that potential entails. The Vajrayana then gives extensive details about the Buddhanature and how it is activated and allowed to develop. This can be accomplished in one life, rather than many lives, as in Mahayana, because direct methods involving the human body are used, rather than indirect methods involving relationships with other beings.

The Vajrayana also has many lineages and each lineage teaches that Vajrayana has many levels involving varying degrees of perfection of "The View." Depending on the lineage the Apex View will either be called Mahamudra (The Majority View) or Dzogchen (The Minority View). However, a modern approach is called Rim√© or ecumenical, and with some ancient precidents like Lord Jigten Sumgon, there is the view that all the views are the same and discrimination between views is ignorant. This approach, which can be called the nondiscriminatory approach included the sutra basket of Prajnaparamita and it's Abhidharma related with Madhyamaka. In one text called Gongchig it also includes the Shravakayana and Shravaka Vinaya, as well as equating the Four Immeasurables, a Shravakayana sutra teaching, with Buddhahood.

A unique feature of Lord Jigten Sumgon's approach is the the first wheel Buddha taught interdependence of cause and effect. In the second wheel he taught cause and effect are empty. And in the third wheel he taught Buddhanature or emptiness in action is interdependent cause and effect. So all the wheels and baskets are interdependent, like a fractal, and so practicing in one wheel entails practicing all.

What a Buddha is in essence is one who automatically responds with compassionate wisdom to assist beings to see what a Buddha sees. What this entails about the third turning is a path to Buddhahood by doing Buddha activities. And by engaging in Buddha activities we learn to master this skill and then that skill grows in power and scope. Thus, we are freed from the burden of time, stages and levels of achievement and can allow our Buddhanature to blossom at our own pace. Due to the truth of interdependent cause and effect, by engaging in Buddha activities we naturally develop the countless samadhis and enjoyments that are shared nondually with all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

What we will do is utilize the tools the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha have provided over 2,600 years of history, from the most basic first turning methods, to the utter limit of what it possible to be taught in Vajrayana and the gurus' intimate experiential instructions and learn how to engage in Buddha activities for our own and others' benefits.

With the counsel of a teacher one can develop a very high level of experience with the Buddha's teachings without having to commit to an extensive practice schedule, without having to renounce the world in years long retreats, and without having to attend numerous lamas and empowerments. The historical precedents for my approach to teaching are well founded in the records in India, Nepal and Tibet. What I've come to is based on applying the traditional approaches to modern life and discovering which tools have the best impact in the lives of people whom I encounter.

Practices to gain familiarity with Buddha activities include recitation of sutras, making various offerings, recitations of prayers, tantric visualizations, occasional rituals, introductions to direct perception of Buddhanature and ways to maintain that perception night and day thought all activities.


Ii.

The Buddha taught samsara in any of the six realms from hell-beings to meditation gods is impermanent, is pointless and is sufferings of endless rebirth, old-age sickness and death. He taught cause and effect or karmaphala of suffering is the natural law. He taught interdependent origination is emptiness, that the cause of suffering may be removed. He taught Buddha activities are in the Buddhanature which is the basis of sa.sara and nirvana. Thus, taught the path. Not knowing and/or having no faith in these points is supreme ignorance for which the only possible result is constant misery.

"What are these four obstacles to the attainment of Buddhahood? Being attached to this life's activities, being attached to the pleasure of samsara, being attached to peace, and not understanding the
method by which enlightenment is achieved." -Jewel Ornament of Liberation, by Gampopa

"If one explained these three sufferings with their definitions, the all-pervasive suffering would be a neutral feeling, the suffering of change would be a feeling of pleasure, and the suffering of
suffering would be a feeling of suffering." -Gampopa

Birth is also a suffering, old age is also a suffering, sickness is also a suffering, death is also a suffering, separating from loved ones is also suffering, meeting with those who are not dear is also suffering, not finding what we desire is also suffering, and the pain of protecting what we already have is also suffering." -Entering the Womb Sutra

The human body has special qualities no present in other sentient beings. If we follow a spiritual master who is like a guide through a dangerous wilderness, we can learn the method to wake up from ignorance into the glorious and joyous wonders of supreme unsurpassable Buddhahood, which is the wisdom of the Buddhanature and the teaching of Bodhichitta.

PRELIMINARIES 

"In other lineages the main practice is considered profound, in our lineage the Preliminaries are profound." Lord Jigten Sumgon in Gongchig 

"You must teach the preliminaries." Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche's exhortation to me

  Common Preliminaries 

          - Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind

Contemplating the subject of impermanence remedies attachment to this life's activities. Reflecting on the faults of samsara and on karma cause and its result remedies attachment to the pleasure of samsara. Meditating on loving-kindness and compassion remedies attachment to the pleasure of peace. Cultivating the supreme bodhicitta is the antidote for not understanding the method by which to achieve enlightenment.        

          - Integrating with the Result

All compounded phenomena are impermanent. All happiness in samsara ends with suffering. All our efforts and aims are never completed. All activities in life are futile and meaningless. Liberation means suffering shall never return. Oral teachings of the guru are the path to liberation. Nonconceptual nonmeditation is what is taught to be the ground from which all blissful Buddha qualities blossom.

  Uncommon Preliminaries

          -Refuge and Bodhichitta

The essence of the cultivation of bodhicitta is the desire to achieve perfect, complete enlightenment for others' benefit. There are two classifications of primary characteristics: ultimate bodhicitta and relative bodhicitta. What is ultimate bodhicitta? It is pervading emptiness endowed with the essence of compassion, clear, unmoving, and free from elaboration. Relative bodhicitta vows to liberate all sentient beings from suffering through compassion. Ultimate bodhicitta is obtained through the realization of Dharmatawhile relative bodhicitta is obtained through ritual ceremony. There are two classifications of relative bodhicitta: aspiration bodhicitta and action bodhicitta. In brief, bodhicitta should be understood to be of two types, The mind that aspires to awaken and the mind that ventures to do so.

The Prajnaparamita is the sound and the syllable A, the pure unborn clear light is the dharmakaya. The continuous presence of luminous appearances is sambhogakaya. Their inseparability is the compassion of the nirmanakaya. We take refuge in our innate nature.

All beings are only confused by a glitch which may fix itself given the right understanding to allow obstacles to liberate themselves in their own pure nature. Out of compassion we rest in the ultimate Bodhicitta of nondistraction.

                  Seven Branch Prayer 

To receive the teachings one must request them respectfully and with a pure heart. So initially and at the start of any practice we recite and perform the actions of the Seven Branches: Performing prostrations, making real and imagined offerings, going for refuge, making confession, rejoicing in the teacher's good qualities, requesting the teacher to turn the wheel of dharma and teach, beseeching the teacher to remain and not attain parinirvana, and the dedication of merit to all sentient beings.

                  The Role of Faith

Some aspects of the path and result of Buddhahood are beyond reason and difficult to experience first hand. Buddha explained we must begin with faith. It's not blind faith. We will put the teachings to the test. It is the kind of trusting faith that you afford your professor on the first day of class, that the professor has such knowledge which you do not have and can impart it to you. 

Thus, we.must habe faith in the Three Jewels: The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, as well as in karma and it's result, the transfer of merit, the samadhis, rebirth in the six realms.of samsara, in the psychic faculties of the noble beings and in the possibility of attaining Buddhahood. The Buddha states specifically that faith in Mahayana is essential to attaining the fruit of practice. The methods will bear out concrete experiences beyond faith but initially we must have confidence and trust that those who came.before us on the path are being honest about it.
  
MAIN PRACTICE 

          -Three statements of Garab Dorje
"The cause of buddhahood comes by way of explanation by the precious guru." -Tantra without Syllables

In the Atiyoga path the guru gives you instructions for you directly to encounter perceptual evidence of your innately present Buddhanature so that you may confirm it to yourself and remain in its presence 24/7. You are given demonstrations and tasks that allow your Buddhanature to blossom like a seedling sprouts and blossoms into full flower. A flower then again multiplies seeds and those seeds make new flowers. This is the analogy I wish will serve to help you understand how you too will all be gurus and Buddhas and this precious teaching will carry on into the distant future 

          -Body is deity, speech is mantra, action is Ganachakrapuja

We integrate all the oaths and paths into our daily life with all our actions of body, speech and mind, waking and sleeping, lying down, sitting up, standing, walking around, talking and serving the needs of sentient beings. We focus often on maintaining mindfulness throughout the day and especially at time of eating and drinking, because this is both a time to repair ourselves and to renew our vows of offering ourselves to dharma. We also focus on the time of sleep when we spend at least a third of our lives, which is an opportunity to overcome many deluded appearances. 

And once again preliminary practices return to exhaust the obstacles of body, speech and mind and gently clarify our vision of dharmata until final buddhahood. There is the preliminary of physical Asana or mudra with symbolic visualizations, the preliminary of mantra recitation and symbolic visualization, as well as the preliminary of deep examination of the mind, among others.

          -The Nine Vehicles and Four Classes of Tantra Are All Good

From time to time our doubts reemerge or we lose our clear perception. At that time we may utilize any one if the myriad methods within the vast tradition of the Mahayana and Vajrayana to refresh and deepen our understanding of the Buddha's intent and repair our confidence in our teachers and the precious lineages which have kept these blessings alive to this day.

The supplemental methods I favor to instill confidence include Co-Emergent Mahamudra, Guhyagarbha, Five-Fold Path Mahamudra, Shitro, some ·∏åƒÅkinƒ´ methods and Yangti dark retreat. Some of these are exceptions to the general principle that one must receive a formal empowerment prior to entering the path. Thus, these are more accessible to an on-line community.

DEDICATION BODHICHITTA 

.At various times throughout the day when we will transfer our merit to all beings of samsara, to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Deities, Protectors and to the Ultimate Bodhichitta so that our practice will gain momentum enough actually to produce benefit to sentient beings.
