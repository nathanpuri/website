The Buddha taught samsara in any of the six realms from hell-beings to meditation gods is impermanent, is pointless and is sufferings of endless rebirth, old-age sickness and death. He taught cause and effect or karmaphala of suffering is the natural law. He taught interdependent origination is emptiness, that the cause of suffering may be removed. He taught Buddha activities are in the Buddhanature which is the basis of sa.sara and nirvana. Thus, taught the path. Not knowing and/or having no faith in these points is supreme ignorance for which the only possible result is constant misery.

"What are these four obstacles to the attainment of Buddhahood? Being attached to this life's activities, being attached to the pleasure of samsara, being attached to peace, and not understanding the
method by which enlightenment is achieved." -Jewel Ornament of Liberation, by Gampopa

"If one explained these three sufferings with their definitions, the all-pervasive suffering would be a neutral feeling, the suffering of change would be a feeling of pleasure, and the suffering of
suffering would be a feeling of suffering." -Gampopa

Birth is also a suffering, old age is also a suffering, sickness is also a suffering, death is also a suffering, separating from loved ones is also suffering, meeting with those who are not dear is also suffering, not finding what we desire is also suffering, and the pain of protecting what we already have is also suffering." -Entering the Womb Sutra

The human body has special qualities no present in other sentient beings. If we follow a spiritual master who is like a guide through a dangerous wilderness, we can learn the method to wake up from ignorance into the glorious and joyous wonders of supreme unsurpassable Buddhahood, which is the wisdom of the Buddhanature and the teaching of Bodhichitta.

PRELIMINARIES 

"In other lineages the main practice is considered profound, in our lineage the Preliminaries are profound." Lord Jigten Sumgon in Gongchig 

"You must teach the preliminaries." Kyabje Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche's exhortation to me

  Common Preliminaries 

          - Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind

Contemplating the subject of impermanence remedies attachment to this life's activities. Reflecting on the faults of samsara and on karma cause and its result remedies attachment to the pleasure of samsara. Meditating on loving-kindness and compassion remedies attachment to the pleasure of peace. Cultivating the supreme bodhicitta is the antidote for not understanding the method by which to achieve enlightenment.        

          - Integrating with the Result

All compounded phenomena are impermanent. All happiness in samsara ends with suffering. All our efforts and aims are never completed. All activities in life are futile and meaningless. Liberation means suffering shall never return. Oral teachings of the guru are the path to liberation. Nonconceptual nonmeditation is what is taught to be the ground from which all blissful Buddha qualities blossom.

  Uncommon Preliminaries

          -Refuge and Bodhichitta

The essence of the cultivation of bodhicitta is the desire to achieve perfect, complete enlightenment for others' benefit. There are two classifications of primary characteristics: ultimate bodhicitta and relative bodhicitta. What is ultimate bodhicitta? It is pervading emptiness endowed with the essence of compassion, clear, unmoving, and free from elaboration. Relative bodhicitta vows to liberate all sentient beings from suffering through compassion. Ultimate bodhicitta is obtained through the realization of Dharmata while relative bodhicitta is obtained through ritual ceremony. There are two classifications of relative bodhicitta: aspiration bodhicitta and action bodhicitta. In brief, bodhicittaShould be understood to be of two types. The mind that aspires to awaken and the mind that ventures to do so.

The Prajnaparamita is the sound and the syllable A, the pure unborn clear light is the dharmakaya. The continuous presence of luminous appearances is sambhogakaya. Their inseparability is the compassion of the nirmanakaya. We take refuge in our innate nature.

All beings are only confused by a glitch which may fix itself given the right understanding to allow obstacles to liberate themselves in their own pure nature. Out of compassion we rest in the ultimate Bodhicitta of nondistraction.

                  Seven Branch Prayer 

To receive the teachings one must request them respectfully and with a pure heart. So initially and at the start of any practice we recite and perform the actions of the Seven Branches: Performing prostrations, making real and imagined offerings, going for refuge, making confession, rejoicing in the teacher's good qualities, requesting the teacher to turn the wheel of dharma and teach, beseeching the teacher to remain and not attain parinirvana, and the dedication of merit to all sentient beings.
