The Path of Atiyoga is unique in it's simplicity, because the entire Mahayana is disclosed directly without necessarily relying on various steps and levels. A guru assists you to encounter your innate Buddhanature. Then, depending on your condition, the guru teaches you any number of possible methods to confirm it to yourself until you can continue in liberation from suffering on your own.

Atiyoga and the intimate instruction traditions of Himalayan Buddhism can seem abstract or theoretical at first, or ineffible and hard to grasp. In a sense, that's the point. It is a healing modality, because it provides tools to used within a community for seeing ourselves from the highest possible vantage point of what we really are as conscious beings and to circumvent our dreads about being and non-being, our identities and histories and removing their unconscious controls over us. 

When we can see, feel and experience a deep sense that at our most basic fundamental level we are compassionate, loving and miraculous creatures of light, a permanent shift in our relationship with the world results whereby we acquire fearlessness and confidence that we are alright; we are good, and firmly planted in a perfect life. And we acquire gentleness and a delicate appreciation for all life, because we all share that exact same fundamental nature.
