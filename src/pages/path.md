Ati is unique among the Buddha's discourses, because there is always a higher disclosure and a faster and more complete teaching. While it contains many teachings that are proper paths, along with empowerments, descriptions of tantric anatomy, activities, yoga positions, mantras, stages and signs of accomplishment and so forth, it also has another mode of operation which is more direct and beyond beginning, middle and end or progression. Buddha's wisdom is vast and it stems from a very simple but elusive and hidden root. With the guidance of a guru like Natan you can discover it for yourself for the purpose of your own deep happiness and peace, one that you can then easily share with others.

What Natan is proposing is to wake you up quickly into the exalted wisdom of all Buddha's of the three times and beyond the limits of time and space.
