The Path of Atiyoga is unique in it's simplicity, because the entire Mahayana is disclosed directly without necessarily relying on various steps and levels. A guru assists you to encounter your innate Buddhanature. Then, depending on your condition, the guru teaches you any number of possible methods to confirm it to yourself until you can continue in liberation from suffering on your own.euy
