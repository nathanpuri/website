You may request puja services, for example, for the pacification of obstacles, illnesses, disturbing spirits, etc., and also for increasing wealth, attracting others, dispelling negative influences, and such. 

If you know someone is dying, you can request end of life service to assist the dying person through the intermediate state. 

One can also request divination.
